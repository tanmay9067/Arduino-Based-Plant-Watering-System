This project focuses on developing an automated plant watering system using the Arduino Uno microcontroller. The system is designed to monitor the soil moisture level in real-time and activate a water pump when the soil becomes too dry. The key goal is to minimize manual effort in watering plants and ensure plants get optimal moisture, making it an ideal solution for home gardens, especially for users who are frequently away or forget to water their plants.

The system employs a soil moisture sensor to detect moisture content in the soil. When the moisture level drops below a predefined threshold, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino. In response, the Arduino triggers a relay module to power the water pump, which waters the plant. Once the required moisture level is reached, the pump automatically turns off.

This smart irrigation system is cost-effective, eco-friendly, and highly efficient, making it a perfect first-year electronics project. It introduces students to basic concepts of embedded systems, sensor interfacing, analog signal reading, and automation.

Key Features:
> Real-time soil moisture monitoring

>Automatic water pump control

>Low-cost and easy to assemble

>Beginner-friendly with potential for future upgrades (e.g., WiFi integration, LCD display)
